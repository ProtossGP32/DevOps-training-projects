# Introduction

# Getting started
## Download LXC template
## Create a new LXC instance
Remember to copy your public SSH key to remotely access the container.

## Define the LXC as a template
## Clone the LXC template
## Access the LXC via Serial console
## Install additional dependencies
Install some useful dependencies:

- Git to clone boschkundendiest repository
- OpenSSL to generate self-signed certificates
- Vim to edit some files
- Also Openssh to ease access to the LXC container

```{.bash filename="Installing OpenSSL in Alpine"}
apk add git openssl vim openssh
# Make openssh available from the LXC boot
rc-update add sshd default
```

## Access LXC via SSH
We should be able to access via SSH to the container as `root` user (we configured our public SSH key on LXC creation time).
